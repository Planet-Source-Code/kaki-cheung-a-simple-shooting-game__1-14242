### Description

a very very simple shooting game. this is the first time I write classes in vb, so my OOD isnt very good (very poor actually). and because i lacked the graphics, so i captured some pictures from some sources (if anyone objects my use of those graphics PLEASE let me know and i'll remove them)

And, please vote and leave a comment!

(due to time limit, the game is obviously unfinished, so if you vote badly because of that, i have nothing to say...)
